# Okra Cards

**Okra Cards** is an open-source flashcard application that implements spaced repetition algorithms to help you learn and retain information efficiently. Unlike proprietary solutions, Okra Cards works with your local markdown files and doesn't require external dependencies.

Inspired by the [Obsidian Spaced Repetition plugin](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition), Okra Cards provides similar functionality without the need for proprietary software. Although not as feature-rich as the plugin, it offers independence from external tools and can be installed on any system with npm.

Built with React and TypeScript, it offers a clean, intuitive interface for creating and reviewing flashcards from your own content.

## üöÄ Features

- **Local Folder Integration**: Select any folder containing markdown (.md) or text (.txt) files as your flashcard source
- **Multiple Card Formats**: Support for various flashcard formats (basic, reversed, multi-line)
- **Spaced Repetition System**: Implements the proven SM-2 algorithm for optimal review scheduling
- **Multi-Deck Support**: Each markdown file in your folder becomes a separate deck
- **Automatic Detection**: Automatically scans and detects all cards in your selected folder
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on all modern browsers with File System Access API support
